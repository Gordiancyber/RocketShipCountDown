### Contribute Policy & Guidelines

## Objective 

Thanks for finding this file before getting started. Let's have a great hacktoberfest this year. 

## Solve an Issue
- Scan through our existing issues and find an issue that interests you. If this issue has been tagged 'Hacktoberfest' it will be a "valid" Issue for Hacktoberfest. 
   
## Create an Issue
- If you find an sentence error, a small typo, or broken link in the documentation create an issue with the tag "content". 
- If you have a feature suggestion, create an issue with the tag **"feature-request"**. To qualify for a "Hacktoberfest" tag a maintainer will need to approve your "feature-request".
- If you have a bug-fix, create an issue with the tag **"bug"** or **"bug-fixed"**. To qualify for a "Hacktoberfest" tag a maintainer will need to approve your "bug-fix".
- If you have a documentation change, as in you have feedback, Create an issue with the tag **"doc-change"**. This change request will be discussed with the maintainer(s) and if eligible further processed to a "Hacktoberfest" tag. 

We encourage both solving and creating issues however, an issue must have a 'Hacktoberfest' tag applied in order to count. 

## Code Of Conduct
